# Industrial Control and Data Acquisition System

LOW-level Engineering modular data acquisition and control hardware platform. The system is a combination of a power supply, integrated I/O, integrated communications interfaces, signal and isolation to interface with expansion modules to tailor it to the application and an FPGA as a main controller.

The system is designed around the DE-10 Nano FPGA board from Terasic, although any embedded controller can be adapted to interface with the two 40-pin IDC connectors.

*Fully Modular I/O interface.
*Expansion Ports with 24V and 5V Power and Signal Isolation.
*Single 24V Power Supply Required.
*Multiple Communications Interfaces Supported, RS-485, CAN, RS-232, USB, SPI and I2C.
